## 🧠 Why I Built This

I needed a simple way to produce a clean, styled resume in PDF format.  
Most online tools overcomplicate the process or lock features behind paywalls.  
So I made my own. One that:

- Runs locally
- Exports instantly
- Lets me edit and update without redoing the entire thing

I built this while dealing with real-world pressure: deadlines, learning curves, and even physical pain.  
I had to **fight to solve one issue that slowed me down—a single misspelled hex color (`"4CAF50"` instead of `"#4CAF50"`)**.  
Tiny typo, big stall.  
But I pressed on: **Hit one, find another. Keep shipping.**

⚔️ Built Under Pressure
I’ve pivoted from sales to dev after a serious back injury.
I taught myself to code, shipped projects on Gumroad and Itch.io, and now I’m building tools that solve real pain points.
This was one of them.

If it helps you, use it. If you improve it, fork it.
But above all: Keep building.
